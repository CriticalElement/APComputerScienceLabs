# APComputerScienceLabs
This is a work-in-progress collection of all the AP Computer Science labs we've been working on.

# Important
When running the code, make sure you set the working directory in your IDE to the parent directory the code is in (not src, not APComputerScienceLabs).
For example, to run `Runner.java` in `NBodySimulation`, you would have to make sure the working directory for that file is `NBodySimulation`.

IntelliJ example:

(ignore the fact that the parent directory is eclipse-workspace, this is IntelliJ)

Alternatively, you can just download the .zip, and extract it somewhere, and open that as a project in your IDE.
